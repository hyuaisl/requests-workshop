Workshop: Testing RESTful APIs in Python with requests
==================
For those of you looking to gain some experience working with [requests](https://requests.readthedocs.io/en/master/), here are all the materials from a workshop I've created and delivered multiple times to good reviews. Feel free to use, share and adapt these materials as you see fit.

Setting up your system
---
1) Make sure you have a working Python 3 installation. Get it from [here](https://www.python.org/downloads/) if you haven't got that already.
2) Download and unzip or clone this project
3) From the project root, run `pip install -r requirements.txt` to install the necessary dependencies

What API is used for the exercises?
---
The exercises use the [Zippopotam.us API](http://api.zippopotam.us/), so make sure that it's up and that you are allowed to access it from your machine.
